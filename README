This is version 1.32 Stable of the library "Free JPDF Pascal".

New's in Version 1.32:
	- Fixed definitely the mistake with the decimal point (especially on Windows);

	- Some corrections were made for performance (speed of generation and memory usage) mentioned here in the forum. For example, were removed SetLength with very high initial values​​. Now were as follows:
	   SetLength(Self.offsets, 3);
	   SetLength(Self.pages, 1);
	   SetLength(Self.OrientationChanges, 1);

	The sample is generated in less than 240 milliseconds.

	New methods have been present since version 1.31:

	SaveToFile
	SaveToStream
	SaveToString
	CreateContentStream(csToViewBrowser)
	CreateContentStream(csToDownload)

	The last two are for use in applications CGI with fcl-web or fp-web. Thus:

	To view the Browser (Adobe plugin):

	AResponse.ContentType := 'application/pdf';
	AResponse.ContentStream := JPDF1.CreateContentStream(csToViewBrowser);

	or simply:

	AResponse.ContentType := 'application/pdf';
	AResponse.ContentStream := JPDF1.CreateContentStream;

	To download directly from the Browser:

	AResponse.ContentType := 'application/x-download';
	AResponse.ContentStream := JPDF1.CreateContentStream(csToDownload);
